                <h3>Technical Proficiency Across Core Areas</h3>
                <p>My ePortfolio demonstrates strength in three critical areas of computer science:</p>

                <p><strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Through the architectural transformation of the Hospital Management System, I demonstrated my ability to design scalable, maintainable software following industry-standard patterns. The refactoring from a monolithic structure with hardcoded data to a modular, repository-based architecture shows my understanding of separation of concerns, abstraction, and design patterns. This work reflects my commitment to writing clean, professional code that can evolve with changing requirements. This quality distinguishes competent developers from those who simply make programs that work.</p>

                <p><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> The scheduling enhancement showcased my ability to analyze problems algorithmically and select appropriate data structures to optimize performance. By implementing priority queues, hash maps, and efficient conflict detection algorithms, I reduced time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) for critical operations. This demonstrates not just theoretical knowledge, but practical application of computer science principles to solve real-world problems efficiently.</p>

                <p><strong>Database Design and Management:</strong> The MongoDB integration proved my capability to design and implement persistent data layers that maintain integrity, support efficient querying, and scale with growing data volumes. Moving from in-memory storage to a production-ready database system required understanding of NoSQL principles, connection management, indexing strategies, and CRUD operations.</p>

                <h3>Professional Values and Work Ethic</h3>
                <p>Beyond technical skills, the capstone process reinforced professional values that will guide my career:</p>

                <p><strong>Commitment to Quality:</strong> Each enhancement went through multiple iterations, incorporating feedback and self-evaluation to ensure the final product met professional standards. I learned that good enough isn't good enough. Excellence requires attention to detail, thorough testing, and continuous improvement.</p>

                <p><strong>Security-First Mindset:</strong> Throughout all enhancements, I prioritized data validation, error handling, and secure design principles. The healthcare domain demands robust security, and my implementations reflect awareness of vulnerabilities and proactive mitigation strategies.</p>

                <p><strong>Documentation and Communication:</strong> Comprehensive Javadoc comments, clear code organization, and detailed enhancement narratives demonstrate my commitment to making my work understandable to others. In collaborative environments, the ability to communicate technical concepts clearly is as important as writing functional code.</p>

                <h3>Career Goals and Employability</h3>
                <p><strong>Immediate Goals:</strong> I am prepared to enter the software development field in roles focusing on backend engineering, full-stack development, or healthcare IT. My Hospital Management System project demonstrates domain knowledge in healthcare applications, positioning me well for opportunities in health tech companies or hospital IT departments.</p>

                <p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> This ePortfolio provides tangible evidence of my capabilities beyond what a resume can convey.

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Although my capstone work was completed independently, my coursework throughout the program provided substantial experience in collaborative environments. In CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle), I learned Agile methodologies and participated in sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives. Additional coursework reinforced these collaborative skills: CS 340 (Advanced Programming Concepts) where I worked with database queries and API integration, CS 405 (Secure Coding) where I analyzed security vulnerabilities collaboratively, and IT 145 (Foundation in Application Development) which provided early exposure to modular programming that supports team development.</p>

                <p>In my professional practice, I applied these collaborative principles by structuring my code with future team members in mind, maintaining clean Git history, writing comprehensive README files and setup instructions, and creating modular components that different team members could work on independently.</p>

                <p><strong>Communicating with Stakeholders:</strong> Effective communication with stakeholders requires translating technical concepts into business value. Throughout my enhancements, I practiced this skill by writing enhancement narratives that explain not just what I built, but why it matters. For example, describing conflict detection not as "implementing an O(n log n) algorithm," but as "preventing double-booking that could negatively impact patient care and hospital operations."</p>
